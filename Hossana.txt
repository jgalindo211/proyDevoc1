I see the king of glory

Coming down the clouds with fire

The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes

I see his love and mercy

Washing over all our sin

The people sing, the people sing



Chorus

Hosanna, hosanna

Hosanna in the highest



Verse 2

I see a generation

Rising up to take the place

With selfless faith, with selfless faith

I see a new revival

Staring as we pray and seek

We're on our knees, we're on our knees



Bridge

Heal my heart and make it clean

Open up my eyes to the things unseen

Show me how to love like you have loved me

Break my heart for what is yours

Everything I am for your kingdom's cause

As I walk from earth into eternity
